### Manage your work with GitHub Projects
- **Describe GitHub Projects**:
	
	It's a planning and tracking tool. It has adaptable and costumizable views, like roadmap, table, kanban, etc. Looks like Jira. Directly integrates with issues and pull requests. Has pre-build workflow for automations.

	_Reference_: [About Projects](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/about-projects)
	
- **Explain the layout options for projects**:
	
	You can create boards, tables, roadmaps

	_Reference_: [Layouts of a project](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/customizing-views-in-your-project/changing-the-layout-of-a-view)
	
- **Describe the configuration options for projects**:
	
	You can create custom fields to categorize and filter your issues and pull requests. 
	Also, projects can be associated to one or many repositories, and have its own configurations for visibility and access. 

	_Reference_: [Managing your project](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/managing-your-project)
	
- **Explain the difference between projects and projects classic**:
	
	- _Projects_: New more dynamic interface, highly customizable, supports automated workflows and Actions, enhanced reporting features and insights, deeper integration with issues and pull requests. More advanced and flexible.
	- _Projects Classic_: Traditional board like Trello, limited customization, basic automation, basic reporting, basic integration with repos. 
	
- **Explain the use of labels**:
	
	They are similar to issue Types in Jira. Are used to categorize issues and pull requests. You can create, edit and delete labels.

  _Reference_: [About Labels](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/managing-labels)

> [!note]
> Now GitHub Issues also have support for [Issue Types](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/configuring-issues/managing-issue-types-in-an-organization), so you can "combo" these features to organize your project.
	
- **Explain the use of milestones**:
	
	To associate issues and pull requests with specific project phases. To have an overview of how much work is left to complete a project phase.

	_Reference_: [About milestones](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/about-milestones)
	
- **Describe how to use and create project template**:
	
	With an organization or enterprise account, you can turn your project into a template. It provides a pre-configured project, that can be used in the organization. As the organization admin, you can also suggest "recommended templates" when users are creating a new project.

  _Reference_: [Project templates](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/managing-your-project/managing-project-templates-in-your-organization)

> [!warning]
> This topic is written as "template repos" in the [Official study guide](https://assets.ctfassets.net/wfutmusr1t3h/1kmMx7AwI4qH8yIZgOmQlP/79e6ff1dfdee589d84a24dd763b1eef7/github-foundations-exam-study-guide__1_.pdf), but they have already been covered in the Domain 2, and I believe project templates are also part of the exam
	
- **Explain how to create, edit and delete saved replies**:
	
	You can add saved replies that you've already set up. You can set them in your account setting or mark a reply as a saved reply.

	_Reference_: [Using saved replies](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-saved-replies/using-saved-replies)
	
- **Describe the benefits of using a saved reply**:
	
	They are useful in routine discussions where you need to send the same answers a lot of times

	GitHub has built-in workflows to help with automation. 
	- Item added to project
	- Item reopened
	- Item closed
	- Code changes requested
	- Code review approved
	- Pull request merged
	- Auto-archive items
	- Auto-add to project
	For more advanced workflows, you can use GitHub Actions
